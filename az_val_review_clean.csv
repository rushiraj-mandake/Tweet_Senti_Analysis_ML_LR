Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option.

For some weird reason the app (timer) stopped working after a few months of installing the app. I used to use it everyday but now all I can do is uninstall it. it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app. I would give this a five star if this was fixed. and it would be much better if this was not a timer. I would much more prefer if you can add a start button and when you finished studying you can just stop it instead. you can't really estimate the time it takes for you to study.,0,weird reason app timer stopped working months installing app. used use everyday uninstall it. kinda weird editors choice app. would give five star fixed. would much better timer. would much prefer add start button finished studying stop instead. can't really estimate time takes study.

"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update.

"This is by far the best to do list app I've come by. It has rich features and a great interface, even in the free version. It knows the difference between a task, and a habit. My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline? Normally, a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for. From what I can see, there's only one. If a one time payment option is added, I'll buy it.",1,"far best list app come by. rich features great interface, even free version. knows difference task, habit. main issue app, premium pricing. exactly pay monthly fee features used offline? normally, monthly subscription support features need consistently paid for. see, there's one. one time payment option added, buy it."

"The app is OK but it could be much better in terms of usability. For example: 1. When setting a new reminder, the first button (which you are most likely to press without thinking) should be 'set timer', not 'share the task'. More people will want to set a reminder than share a person note. 2. The 'focus' button when the reminder comes up is in the prime location for when you are typing/using your phone and leads to you accidentally cancelling reminders each time.",1,"app ok could much better terms usability. example 1. setting new reminder, first button likely press without thinking 'set timer', 'share task'. people want set reminder share person note. 2.

The idea is better than the execution. Buying things from the store requires you to create an account in their app rather than using the play store account.

I have never rated an app before. I rave about it to others. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize. I love having the widget on my phone.

Only thing I struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks (hold and drag). Works better for moving tasks down than up. Maybe my screen is not responsive enough or I'm clumsy.,2,never rated app before. rave others. perfect blend simplicity options customize. love widget phone. expanded see many items list. love different options reminders snoozing. hard time transitioning task task. thing struggle manual reorder tasks hold drag . works better moving tasks up. maybe screen responsive enough clumsy.

"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day.

"Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!",2,"really love app. helps organize time schedule. could make hours numbering front sector, adding option showing minute division lines would really help read better. setting hours numbering outside clock makes look kinda crowded, hour numbers 12, 3, 6, 9 shown kinda bothers me. also please make preview clock settings need switch app homescreen see changes. really looking forward see features fixed. overall, great app!"

"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll.

The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",2,"good app, exactly looking for. app uses calendar events organizes circle. controls great, love move red time bar scrolls things shows time changing. love widget. wanted work homeschool schedule. ended make new calendar syncing one. able change colors event app. easy use overall."
