"Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it.",2,"written bad review spent week trying make app show two widgets different calendars. wasted hours! noticed nearly invisible dot least screen, using iblue app near widgets. pressed discovered widget menu! really make stick write clear instructions app. imagine try make subtle order affect app looks, took week find it."

"Eh, it wasn't for me. Maybe it's because I was using the free version, I didn't think this app was very intuitive at all. First of all, it's very annoying to not be able to set my own reminder times for tasks. I had the option to either choose 9 in the morning or 6 in the evening. What the heck? Secondly, the reminder feature goes off a little too often. Only one reminder is needed. I know I could have turned notifications off, but I did want reminders for my tasks. I should have been able to control the number of reminders. Also, it was pretty lame that I couldn't make multiple lists. I was just dissatisfied overall with my limited options. I deleted and am using another to do list app",1,"eh, me. maybe using free version, think app intuitive all. first all, annoying able set reminder times tasks. option either choose 9 morning 6 evening. heck? secondly, reminder feature goes little often. one reminder needed. know could turned notifications off, want reminders tasks. able control number reminders. also, pretty lame make multiple lists. dissatisfied overall limited options. deleted using another list app"

It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",0,"trying figure custom time set add notification options, seem way. example, need set 1 hour 30 minutes, there's option that. need ability enter exactly number minutes hours want, instead presets. edit using while, app plagued reliability issues. often late notification minutes, service completely stops restart service. due issue, cannot rely app anything time sensitive end late appointments jobs. contacted developer multiple times far able fix issue."

Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference!

Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,2,fantastic app 4 stars. every part comfortable experience started trying use across devices. took around 30 minutes set tasks first time signed account app tasks made got overwritten default tasks device. partially fault careless order signed devices. perhaps issue could avoided entirely attempted sync tasks internet first time asked wanted use database internet local. would saved lot headache remaking tasks again. said every function provided great would recommend.

"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going.

It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1.",2,"regardless free version app's intention help users increase positive habits reduce negative habits. someone like needs feedback, percentage success gives incentive motivates keep chain going. using app almost two months able analyze critique apps features. would interesting know scientific statistics success app successful set do. regards level engagement would say percentage strategy keeps coming back app. functionality, free version runs smoothly, clear, easy use. aesthetics, simple convenient however think users might difficult see due size buttons font size. information bit outdated needs cited come credible sources. enjoy seeing discussion board communication users. subjective analysis app's rating 4.1."

"This app has greatly helped me in creating better study habits and eliminating procrastination (I'm a high school senior for reference). Part of the reason is because, rather than simply completely blocking usage of apps, it allows you to choose to break your streak, forcing you to actually consider the consequences of procrastinating. My only gripe is that I feel like the ability to whitelist apps should be free (although it is only around $3, which isn't bad). I'd recommend it to anyone.",2,"app greatly helped creating better study habits eliminating procrastination high school senior reference . part reason because, rather simply completely blocking usage apps, allows choose break streak, forcing actually consider consequences procrastinating. gripe feel like ability whitelist apps free although around 3, bad . recommend anyone."

"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function.",1,"really looking app lets multiple repeats task within day, everyday. duplicating task multiple times making subtasks seems way, clutters task list like 8 lines reminded drink 8 glasses water subtasks show twice daily list, within outside main task. thought repeat every 1 day, 8 times custom setting might work, different function."

I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today.

Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.,0,made account app long time ago use long forgot downloaded today. one apps that's incredibly frustrating lot main advertised features behind pay wall make additional account for. paying 1 mo list app ridiculous. anything one time purchase.
